                        <h3>My Thoughts on the Class</h3>
                        <p>This class is a godsend for me, as I am not the best at math. So this class provides me with a convenient way to get my last math credit.
                        Furthermore, this class is very useful, as everything taught in it has helpful real-world applications. 
                        I took another personal finance class before, so a lot of this is familiar to me, but it is very helpful to have a refresher - since it is all so important - and to go more in-depth on some topics than I did before.</p>
