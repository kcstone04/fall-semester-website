                        <h3>My Thoughts on the Class</h3>
                        <p>This class is very relevant to many of the potential fields I want to go into, so it is very important that I take this.
                        A lot of the content covered thus far is stuff I have done before (HTML), but it is being covered in greater depth, so I really appreciate it. 
                        I was worried about the use of AI in this class at first (especially with the AI image on the Canvas page), but so far it has all been ethical and logical in its use.
                        Overall, I am enjoying the class so far, and am excited to learn more!</p>
