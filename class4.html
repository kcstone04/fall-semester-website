                    <p class="description">This class is about reading and writing anything from children's board books to young adult fiction.
                    We read snippets of novels, board books, manga, and more in class, then discuss it.

                        <h3>My Thoughts on the Class</h3>
                        <p>This is a more specialized creative writing class, but I find it to also be fairly chill and relaxing.
                        The class is largely open discussion, and I know many of my fellow classmates from previous classes and organizations.
                        Personally I have little interest in board books, but manga and YA novels are up my alley, so the class is overall very interesting to me.</p>
