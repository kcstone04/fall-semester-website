                    <p class="description">This class is about writing creative works of fiction. 
                    The main focus of the class is writing workshops, wherein we read our classmates' pieces, then discuss them in class.
                    Eventually, your own piece will also be workshopped, providing you with a wealth of feedback which can be used to improve it.</p>

                        <h3>My Thoughts on the Class</h3>
                        <p>This class is very relaxing and chill to be in. I have taken this exact same class before, with the exact same professor.
                        I enjoyed it the first time, and I am enjoying it this time as well. There are more people than there were previously, so there is more peer feedback to be had.
                        I also love having a space to share and build upon my creative works.</p>
