                        <h3>My Thoughts on the Class</h3>
                        <p>This class is similar, yet distinctly different from Developing Intelligent Content, which I find makes it interesting to be taking them simultaneously. 
                        I have been enjoying the class projects thus far, especially because I chose Steam, a PC gaming platform, as my software.
                        I am very familiar with using it, which makes instructional assignments easy, and the survey went super quick because I know so many people who use it.</p>
